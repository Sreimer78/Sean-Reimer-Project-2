  <p>I am a die-hard fan of the Chicago Bulls (despite our autrocious season) and I have been playing basketball since I was 3 years old.  I took it more serious and competitively the last 5 years to improve on my health.</p>
  <p>My favorite video games are DOOM (1993 & 2016), Bioshock, Pokemon red version, Diablo II, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Dead by Daylight</p>
  <p>I currently own a 2006 Chrysler 300C, and have modified some of the Chrome on the exterior, and upgraded my interior with LED lights, a new tablet-screen radio, and my speaker system.</p>
  <p>I have been playing drums since I was 14.  I started DJing in 2014.  Since I got into DJing, I have expanded my live sound system, and utilize it when I DJ weddings, gigs, and with local live bands (including my bands).  On top of that, I ordered DMX lights the last 2 years to expand my production as a live musician, and it really helps out for both the crowd and the band to enjoy the event!</p>
  <p>I use Ableton Live 8 (soon to upgrade to Live 10) as my DAW for producing music.  I highly enjoy remixing video game OST, and 90's hip-hop.  My favorite producer is Dr. Dre</p>
